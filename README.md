# TelemetryReplayer

A telemetry replayer for f1 2018

You need [F1Telemetry](https://github.com/btastic/F1Telemetry) and use the [TelemetryRecorder](https://github.com/btastic/F1Telemetry/blob/master/F1Telemetry/Manager/TelemetryRecorder.cs) class to record sessions.

Recording functionality will probably come some time
